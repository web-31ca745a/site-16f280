            "I've really been trying to change, I've been reaching out to people, which I almost never do, going to therapy, I've had some really hard nights, some really tough conversations and realizations.",
            "One of my friends especially sent me a really powerful message after I explained everything to them, they were genuinely pissed off at me and I think it's what I needed to hear. Everyone that I told agreed that both of us fucked up but especially me.",
            "Once I had multiple people express to me how my avoidant behavior also hurt them in the past obviously not to the extent it did you, but once I heard that, I realized this is something I need to change not just for you but because I can't keep living this way."

            "I've gotten more to the root of the problem, we figured my avoidant behavior was caused by how I grew up.",
            "I'm a pretty good friend and boyfriend when times are good but when things go bad, I bottle things up, I avoid talking about the issue or processing my emotions, I just ~~try to convince myself~~ lie to myself that I'm fine, that I'm \"over\" it. Being distant and always finding a way to keep \"busy\" was part of that, not getting you anything for your birthday or anniversary, making you feel like you didn't matter, and I'm so sorry you had to deal with that for so long, it wasn't okay at all.",
            "It's only really been one month since I've started to work on this part of myself so I don't expect you to trust me yet. Time has only made me realize even more how much I care, and all the feelings I was avoiding have started to hit me in full force."

            "You're so creative, the things you make are amazing, it's been incredible to watch you grow as a crochet artist, as a painter, generally anything creative. I remember these doodles you made, a whole page of little characters with their own personalities, and another with these colorful blob creatures that somehow all felt so alive and expressive. I was genuinely in awe of how your mind works, how you can just create these entire worlds from nothing, but I ~~don't think~~ know I didn't tell you that properly.",

            "**Late Nights** I miss being so close with you that you could tell me every detail of your life, even the things that were maybe a little TMI. I loved that you trusted me with everything.",
            "I miss talking to you until late at night after a day of laughing so hard that my face literally hurt afterwards. The way you never wanted to go. I miss watching you fall asleep on call, or when you'd ask to nap together. You were always **my sleepy girl**.",
            "**Gaming Together** I miss playing games with you. Playing Mario Kart and having you get so competitive you'd actually get a little upset. I love how you always shared your favorite games with me, The Walking Dead, Life is Strange, The Last of Us, Little Nightmares. I always had so much fun playing them with you and they all left such a big impact on me. I can't look at Overgrowth without thinking of The Last of Us, and in turn, you. __Those are games I just can't play again unless it's with you.__",
            "I miss playing Minecraft with you. I got to see your building skills evolve over time. I love how you always wanted to have food prepared for us, how cute and scared you always were at night.",
            "One of my favorite memories is you playing Tetris Effect and getting so excited and happy when I would praise you. __The look on your face was fucking priceless.__",
            "**The Little Things** I miss how excited you would get whenever I brought up a memory, or the excitement and look on your face whenever I got you any gift. You were always so appreciative. I love when you would randomly hold your controller to the camera and be like \"look at this controller my boyfriend got me!\" It always made my fucking day when you would do things like that.",
            "I miss all the silly things you would say. The way you purposefully mispronounce words just to make them more fun to say. The way you always had a fun new word you loved to spam. I fucking miss **my baby**, having you trust me enough to go into baby mode.",
            "**Our First Night** The first night we spent together is one of my favorite memories of all time. Staying up until 3am. The way you'd get so tired but still love me so sleepily. How you kept crawling on me and kissing me all over. How you'd sleep holding onto my arm. How you would dig your feet into me as we cuddled, and even when you'd bend my nails back a bit.",
            "Seeing you at the airport that day is a day I'll never forget. I thought you were **even more beautiful in person**, your hair, your face, it's all ingrained in me. Even how you immediately had to use the restroom after was just very you.",
            "**Everything** I could go on forever. My monitor missed having you on it. My headphones miss your voice. My phone misses your notifications. I even miss just having you complain about your day, your goodnight messages. __I miss everything about you.__"

            "I'll be honest, I spent a lot of this month trying to figure out how to \"win\" you back but that was really immature, I hurt you way too much, **you don't deserve to be with the avoidant version of me**, you really do deserve better but __I still hope I can be that person for you.__",
            "I want to talk about what we both really want, even when it's hard, even when it hurts. __No more avoiding things like I did before.__ I want to prove that when times get bad, **I'll communicate instead of shutting down.**",
            "I want to show you my culture, to dance with you. There's this song, {{video:/videos/coqueta-dance.mp4|\"COQUETA\"}} that I've sent to you in memes before. **I want to learn to dance it with you someday.**",
            "I'm going to keep working on myself because it's what I need to do whether you ever take me back or not. I know the distance is hard, I hate it too. But I'm graduating soon, learning to drive, and I'll get a job so I can visit you multiple times next year. I want to meet your family, especially your dad. I want you to meet mine. __I have real plans to make this work, not just words.__"

            "I want to keep talking to you, to fall in love with you all over again. We can take things slow, get to know each other again. At worst maybe we'll realize it's not going to work out, but at best we can build something stronger than we ever had before.",
            "Trying means talking consistently, both of us putting in effort, being honest about how we're feeling, slowly rebuilding trust. Not jumping back into a relationship right away, but genuinely seeing if we can grow together.",
            "I still think you could be the love of my life. If you 100% can't see yourself with me, I'm ready to let go, but I need to know I gave it my best try.",
            "So my question is simple: __Is there any part of you that wants to try?__ I'm ready to put in the work, to show up differently. But I can't do it alone, I need you to meet me partway. If yes, I'm all in. If no, I'll accept that and let you go.",
            "You don't have to decide right this second. Take two weeks to really think about it, about what you want, about whether you believe I can actually change, about whether you're willing to give this a chance. We can talk during that time if you have questions."
