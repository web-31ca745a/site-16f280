            "I've really been trying to change, I've been reaching out to people, which I almost never do, going to therapy, I've had some really hard nights, some really tough conversations and realizations.",
            "One of my friends especially sent me a really powerful message after I explained everything to them, they were genuinely pissed off at me and I think it's what I needed to hear. Everyone that I told agreed that both of us fucked up but especially me.",
            "Once I had multiple people express to me how my avoidant behavior also hurt them in the past obviously not to the extent it did you, but once I heard that, I realized this is something I need to change not just for you but because I can't keep living this way."

            "I've gotten more to the root of the problem, we figured my avoidant behavior was ~~probably~~ definitely caused by how I grew up.",
            "I'm a pretty good friend and boyfriend when times are good but when things go bad, I bottle things up, I avoid talking about the issue or processing my emotions, I just ~~try to convince myself~~ lie to myself that I'm fine, that I'm \"over\" it. Being distant and always finding a way to keep \"busy\" was part of that, and I'm so sorry you had to deal with that for so long, it wasn't okay at all.",
            "It's only really been one month since I've started to work on this part of myself so I don't expect you to trust me yet. But **I really love you bella**, time has only made me realize that even more, all the feelings I was avoiding have started to hit me in full force."

            "I remember when I used to say you were a girl straight from a book or a fairytale, I find you so fucking endearing, You really are magical and I can't believe I blinded myself from seeing that again for so long.",
            "You're so creative, the things you make are amazing, it's been incredible to watch you grow as a crochet artist, as a painter, generally anything creative. I remember these doodles you made - a whole page of little characters with their own personalities, and another with these colorful blob creatures that somehow all felt so alive and expressive. I was genuinely in awe of how your mind works, how you can just create these entire worlds from nothing, but I ~~don't think~~ know I didn't tell you that properly.",

            "Your mind is amazing as well, I think you're more intelligent than you give yourself credit for. Playing games, watching movies, spending time with you has always been a fucking treat, you know I don't like sweet things but **I like you a lot**."

            "I still want to do those things with you, even now I know there's games I'll never play unless I can play them with you, whenever I see an interesting looking movie my first thought is still that I want to watch it with you.",
            "I'll be honest, I spent a lot of this month trying to figure out how to \"win\" you back but that was really immature, I hurt you way too much, you don't deserve to be with the avoidant version of me, you really do deserve better but I still hope I can be that person for you.",
            "I'm going to keep working on myself because it's what I need to do weather you ever take me back or not. I talked to my therapist about how I was feeling, how I still absolutely loved you and she told me to take things slow, the last relationship clearly had issues and that if it was ever going to work it would only be as we both worked on ourselves. She told me to stay in contact with you though and see how things go, that's part of why I'm writing this."

            "I still think you could be the love of my life. If you 100% can't see yourself with me, I'm ready to let go, but I need to know I gave it my best try.",
            "So my question is simple: __Is there any part of you that wants to try?__ I'm ready to put in the work, to show up differently. But I can't do it alone, I need you to meet me partway. If yes, I'm all in. If no, I'll accept that and let you go.",
            "You don't have to decide right this second. Take two weeks to really think about it, about what you want, about whether you believe I can actually change, about whether you're willing to give this a chance. We can talk during that time if you have questions."
